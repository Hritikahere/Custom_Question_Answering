# Custom_Question_Answering
Simpletransformer library is based on the Transformers BERT library by HuggingFace. The goal of Question Answering is to find the answer to a question given a question and an accompanying context. The predicted answer will be either a span of text from the context or an empty string (indicating the question cannot be answered from the context.)
